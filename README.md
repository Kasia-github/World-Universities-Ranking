## World Universities Ranking 
The global higher education landscape is highly diverse, with universities differing widely in strengths, research capabilities, and educational quality. Analyzing global rankings can offer valuable insights for students, educators, policymakers, and institutions. 


**Introduction**

The World Universities Ranking project aims to examine and visualize universities' standings worldwide, revealing trends, patterns, and factors influencing their global positions. This analysis will provide valuable insights to university management teams, helping them understand and enhance their competitive positioning in the global education landscape.

**Key Questions & Objectives**

The aim of the project is to examine and visualize universities' standings worldwide, to reveal trends, patterns, and factors influencing their global positions.

 - Which universities have shown significant improvement in their rankings?
 - What factors contribute most to the ranking of a university?
 - Which countries have the highest number of top-ranked universities?
 - Where are universities with high research output located?
 - How do ranking figures vary across different continents and regions?


**Data**

The datasets used were:
 - Center for World University Rankings (CWUR)



**Tools**
The data was analyzed using Python and the following supporting libraries:
- Pandas: for data analysis
- Numpy: for mathematical equations
- Seaborn: for data visualizations
- Matplotlib: for data visualizations
- SciPy: for mathematical equations
- Statsmodels.api: for statistical modeling
- Sklearn: for data mining, data analysis, and machine learning
  
Data visualization tools for presenting insights to the management board
 - Tableau


**Folders**

The project files are stored in following folder structure:
- 01 Project Management: Project brief
- 02 Data: Separated into two subfolders Original Data which contain the original data frame and Prepared Data contain the data frame after it has been cleaned and prepared for analysis.
- 03 Scripts: Jupyter notebooks containing coding for the analysis.
- 04 Analysis: The Visualizations subfolder contains the visualizations used for developing and explaining insights.
